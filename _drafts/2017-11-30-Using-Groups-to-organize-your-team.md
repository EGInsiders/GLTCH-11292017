<p>The groups feature can be used to separate students into segments or classes within the team. Groups are especially helpful when you need to filter the Metrics page or the member management page so that you are shown only the students that you want to monitor.</p>
<h2>Inviting Students</h2>
<p>During the process of inviting students, you will want to either obtain an invite code for your group or create a new group which you can add students to as they are joining the team. To do this, you would navigate to the Groups page. For more information on inviting students to the team, see [Adding Members to groups]</p>
<h2>Managing Group Members</h2>
<p>You can manage your students’ membership inside a group either from the Groups page, the Members page, or from an individual students’ Edit Membership page.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Coaches can use the groups feature within the team to separate the coaches and students on their team into smaller units. You’ll find “Groups” in the main menu. Group management page</p>
<p>From the group management page, coaches can create a new group, follow a group, assign members to a group, turn auto groups on or off, view a group’s join code, and access a group’s edit page.</p>
<p>Members can also be added to groups from the Member Management page and from each group’s edit page.</p>
<h2>Following Groups</h2>
<p>While members are added to groups, coaches join a group as follower. When a coach is a follower of the group, the group will appear in their list of filters on the Metrics page, and they will receive daily and weekly team progress reports.</p>
